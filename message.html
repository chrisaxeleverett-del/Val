            <h2>To My Loves, </h2>
            <p>Happy Valentine's Day!</p>
            <p> Well, technically it's only for couples but i just wanted to take a moment to say that "u are loved " & thank you.The word thank you is too simple to truly express how greatful I am of you guys but thank you, my loves.</p>
            <p> And that "I love you guys." Each of you have a good kind heart and a resilient spirit. Even when life try to break you, you still manage to keep on fighting and stand tall. When I say that you are strong, i don't say it not because you can keep on fighting and doesn't fall apart but  because you are kind, caring, valunerable like any human and not afraid to show it.  </p>
            <p> I think that especially in this society we live in, it's harder to keep being kind, caring, valuerable than to block it all and keep on fighting. I'm not sure if it makes sense but the point is that I'm proud of you , and i'm very lucky that i can call you my friends, my loves. Lastly, I want to tell you that you can always text me when you need someone to talk or just be there to listen no matter where we are and where life takes us. My DM is always open for you all. Never be afraid to be valunerable, my loves. It's not fair that we get to smile and laugh together but you have to be all alone when you are at your low, and when you need to fall apart. </p>
            <p>To conclude, I love you and I am proud of you! Take care of yourself & be kind to yourselves, my loves. 😘🐼</p>
